    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. Databases are used in a variety of applications, from managing large amounts of customer data for a business to powering websites and online applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database technologies that have different approaches to storing and accessing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that organize data into tables and use SQL to manipulate and retrieve data. SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as banking systems, inventory management, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, schema-less way. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and can handle a high volume of read and write operations. NoSQL databases are often used for big data and real-time applications, such as social media analytics and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases can use a variety of data models such as key-value, document, graph, and column-family.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are often more scalable than SQL databases, as they can easily add more nodes to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "Flexibility: NoSQL databases are more flexible than SQL databases, as they don't require a predefined schema, which makes it easier to store different types of data. However, this can also make it harder to query the data.\n",
    "Transactions: SQL databases support ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) which ensure that database operations are executed correctly, while NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to create, modify, and delete the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL statements do not affect the data stored in the database, but only the schema or structure of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main DDL commands used in SQL are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE. Here's how each of these commands is used\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures. Here's an example of creating a new table in SQL:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "This SQL code will create a new table named \"employees\" with four columns: \"id\", \"name\", \"department\", and \"salary\".\n",

    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL code will delete the \"employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns or changing the data type of a column. Here's an example of altering a table in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD email VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL code will add a new column named \"email\" to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data from a table, but not the table itself. Here's an example of truncating a table in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL code will delete all the data from the \"employees\" table, but the table itself will remain in the database.\n",

    "In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two types of constraints that are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",

    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and to prevent duplicate data from being entered into the table. Each table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "For example, in a table of employees, the \"id\" column can be used as the primary key. This means that each employee in the table would have a unique \"id\" value, and this value would be used to identify each employee in the table.\n",

    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in one table that is used to refer to the primary key of another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, and it is used to enforce referential integrity between the two tables.\n",

This means that each order would be associated with a particular employee, and the foreign key would ensure that only valid employee IDs can be entered into the orders table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table, and a foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. These constraints are important for maintaining data integrity and for establishing relationships between tables in a relational database."
